# Lucky-Sevens

A game built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap intended to demonstrate the use of those technologies and the futility of playing Lucky Sevens.

## Steps to Play

1. Enter a sum of money you want to play with, and click "Play".
2. As long as there is money left, the game will continue.
3. Each round, the program rolls a virtual pair of dice for the user.
4. If the sum of the 2 dice is equal to 7, the player wins $4. Otherwise, the player loses $1.
5. At the end of the game, the program will display your starting bet, total rolls before going broke, highest amount won, and roll count at highest amount won. 
6. Select "Play Again" to start over.
